## Overview

This project investigates how sleep health metrics ‚Äî such as **sleep duration**, **quality of sleep**, and **physical activity** ‚Äî influence an individual's **stress level**. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we build models that predict stress levels and uncover key insights from real-world lifestyle data.

## Problem Statement

Poor sleep has long been correlated with elevated stress, often accompanied by increased cortisol, adrenaline, and norepinephrine levels. This project explores:

- The relationship between sleep patterns and stress
- Predicting stress levels from lifestyle and physiological indicators
- Providing interpretable visualizations for model insights

## Machine Learning Models Used

| Model                   | Accuracy | Avg Error |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 88.00%   | 17.33%       |
| Random Forest Classifier| 93.33%   | 12.00%        |
| XGBoost Classifier      | 92.00%   | 13.33%      |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | 92.00%   | 13.33%       |
| Support Vector Machine  | 90.67%   | 14.67%     |

‚úÖ **Evaluation**: Feature importance and confusion matrices.

## Visualizations

- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature importance bar charts
- Pair plots and histograms showing stress distribution
- Boxplots: Stress vs. Physical Activity Level

---

## Key Findings

- **Sleep Duration** and **Quality of Sleep** were the strongest predictors of stress.
- Individuals with **low** or **very high** physical activity levels tended to have higher stress.
- **Sleep Disorders** such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea showed strong correlation with elevated stress levels.
